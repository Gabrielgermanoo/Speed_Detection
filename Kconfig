    config VEHICLE_SPEED_DETECTION
        bool "Enable Vehicle Speed Detection"
        default y
        help
            This option enables the vehicle speed detection feature in the system.
            It allows the system to monitor and report the speed of the vehicle in real-time.
            This feature is essential for applications that require speed monitoring and control.
    config SENSOR_DISTANCE_MM
        int "Distance between sensors (mm)"
        range 100 1000
        depends on VEHICLE_SPEED_DETECTION
        help
            The physical distance between the two magnetic sensors in millimeters.
            This value is used to calculate vehicle speed when a vehicle passes
            over both sensors. A larger distance generally provides more accurate
            speed measurements but requires more space for installation.
    
    config SPEED_LIMIT_KMH
        int "Maximum speed permited (km/h)"
        range 10 300
        default 60
        depends on VEHICLE_SPEED_DETECTION
        help
            The maximum allowed vehicle speed in kilometers per hour.
            This value is used to trigger alarms or log over-speed events
            when a vehicle's calculated speed exceeds this limit.
            Adjust this setting according to local traffic regulations.

    config SENSOR_DEBOUNCE_MS
        int "Sensor debounce time (ms)"
        range 10 500
        default 50
        depends on VEHICLE_SPEED_DETECTION
        help
            The debounce time for the sensors in milliseconds. This is the time
            that the system will wait after detecting a signal from one sensor
            before considering it valid. A longer debounce time can help to filter
            out noise and false signals, but may also delay the detection of a vehicle.
            A value of 10ms is generally a good starting point.

    menu "Thread Configuration"
        config THREAD_STACK_SIZE
            int "Max stack size used in threads"
            default 1024
            help
                The maximum stack size used in threads. This value is used to
                allocate the stack space for each thread. A larger stack size
                allows for more complex operations and more local variables,
                but also consumes more memory. A value of 1024 bytes is generally
                a good starting point for most applications.

        config THREAD_PRIORITY
            int "Thread priority"
            default 5
            range 0 10
            help
                The priority of the threads in the system. This value determines
                the order in which threads are scheduled for execution. A higher
                priority value means that the thread will be executed before
                lower priority threads. A value of 5 is generally a good starting
                point for most applications.

            string "Default SNTP server"
            default "200.160.7.186"
            help
                The default SNTP server to use for time synchronization. This
                server will be used if no other server is specified. The server
                should be reachable from the network and should support SNTP
                requests.

        config SYSTEM_SIMULATION
            bool "Enable system simulation"
            default n
            help
                This option enables the system simulation mode. In this mode,
                the system will simulate the behavior of the vehicle speed detection
                system without actually using any hardware. This is useful for
                testing and debugging purposes.
        config SIMULATION_SPEED
            int "Simulation speed (km/h)"
            range 0 300
            default 60
            depends on SYSTEM_SIMULATION
            help
                The speed of the simulated vehicle in kilometers per hour. This
                value is used to simulate the behavior of the vehicle speed detection
                system. A value of 60 km/h is generally a good starting point for
                most applications.
