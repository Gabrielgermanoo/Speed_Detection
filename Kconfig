    config VEHICLE_SPEED_DETECTION
        bool "Enable Vehicle Speed Detection"
        default y
        help
            This option enables the vehicle speed detection feature in the system.
            It allows the system to monitor and report the speed of the vehicle in real-time.
            This feature is essential for applications that require speed monitoring and control.
    config SENSOR_DISTANCE_MM
        int "Distance between sensors (mm)"
        range 100 1000
        depends on VEHICLE_SPEED_DETECTION
        help
            The physical distance between the two magnetic sensors in millimeters.
            This value is used to calculate vehicle speed when a vehicle passes
            over both sensors. A larger distance generally provides more accurate
            speed measurements but requires more space for installation.

    config SENSOR_DEBOUNCE_MS
        int "Sensor debounce time (ms)"
        range 10 500
        default 50
        depends on VEHICLE_SPEED_DETECTION
        help
            The debounce time for the sensors in milliseconds. This is the time
            that the system will wait after detecting a signal from one sensor
            before considering it valid. A longer debounce time can help to filter
            out noise and false signals, but may also delay the detection of a vehicle.
            A value of 10ms is generally a good starting point.

        config THREAD_STACK_SIZE
            int "Max stack size used in threads"
            default 1024
            help
                The maximum stack size used in threads. This value is used to
                allocate the stack space for each thread. A larger stack size
                allows for more complex operations and more local variables,
                but also consumes more memory. A value of 1024 bytes is generally
                a good starting point for most applications.

        config THREAD_PRIORITY
            int "Thread priority"
            default 5
            range 0 10
            help
                The priority of the threads in the system. This value determines
                the order in which threads are scheduled for execution. A higher
                priority value means that the thread will be executed before
                lower priority threads. A value of 5 is generally a good starting
                point for most applications.
