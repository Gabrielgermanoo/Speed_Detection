        bool "Enable Vehicle Speed Detection"
        default y
        help
            This option enables the vehicle speed detection feature in the system.
            It allows the system to monitor and report the speed of the vehicle in real-time.
            This feature is essential for applications that require speed monitoring and control.
    config SENSOR_DISTANCE_MM
        int "Distance between sensors (mm)"
        range 100 1000
        depends on VEHICLE_SPEED_DETECTION
        help
            The physical distance between the two magnetic sensors in millimeters.
            This value is used to calculate vehicle speed when a vehicle passes
            over both sensors. A larger distance generally provides more accurate
            speed measurements but requires more space for installation.

    config SENSOR_DEBOUNCE_MS
        int "Sensor debounce time (ms)"
        range 10 500
        default 50
        depends on VEHICLE_SPEED_DETECTION
        help
            The debounce time for the sensors in milliseconds. This is the time
            that the system will wait after detecting a signal from one sensor
            before considering it valid. A longer debounce time can help to filter
            out noise and false signals, but may also delay the detection of a vehicle.
            A value of 10ms is generally a good starting point.
